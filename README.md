# Title: Backpropagation in  Neural Network

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is a fundamental algorithm used to train neural networks. It enables the neural network to learn from data by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases of the network's connections based on the prediction errors.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the backpropagation algorithm:

# Forward Pass:
Input data is passed through the neural network, and activations are computed at each layer, starting from the input layer and progressing through the hidden layers to the output layer.
The activations are calculated using the weights and biases of the network and the activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) applied to each neuron.
Compute Loss: Compare the network's output with the desired output (ground truth) and compute the loss or error, typically using a loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss.

# Backward Pass:
Start from the output layer and compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the activations of the output neurons.
Propagate the gradients backward through the network, layer by layer, using the chain rule of calculus.
At each layer, compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights and biases of that layer using the gradients from the next layer and the activation values of the current layer.
Update the weights and biases of each layer using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent or its variants. The updates are proportional to the gradients and the learning rate hyperparameter.
Iterate: Repeat the forward pass, computing the loss, and the backward pass for a new batch of training data.
Adjust the weights and biases of the network iteratively, aiming to minimize the loss function.

# Training Completion:
Repeat the iterations until the model has reached the desired level of accuracy or the loss has converged.
Optionally, apply techniques like early stopping or regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Backpropagation allows the neural network to learn by gradually updating the weights and biases based on the gradients of the loss function. By iteratively adjusting these parameters, the network improves its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

It's worth noting that backpropagation is most commonly used in conjunction with gradient-based optimization algorithms, where the computed gradients are used to update the weights and biases in the direction that minimizes the loss function.
